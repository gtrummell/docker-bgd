Railyard Canary-style Blue-Green Deployer
=========================================

Railyard is a demonstration of deploying a new version of a containerized
application at a controlled rate.  This allows a "Canary" for a new
application version (app-green) into an existing environment (app-blue)
precisely instead of linear or fixed methods commonly used in pure blue-
green deployments.  Railyard accomplishes this by controlling traffic to
containers through a load balancer.


How Railyard works
-----------

Railyard assumes that a container orchestrator is launching and tearing
down containers on one or more instances (i.e. Mesos, SWARM, Nomad, etc.).
Registrator listens for new containers launched on each instance, then
registers them in Consul as new services.  One or more containers running
Nginx receive configurations managed by Consul-Template.  Operators can
manually set a deployment weight for each version of the application in
Consul, or they can automate application weights using the Consul API.
